- 👋 Hi, I’m WIll!
- 👀 I’m a friendly, neighborhood Web Developer, with a focus on front-end technologies! I climb rocks, play video games and cherish the present moment.
- 🌱 My strengths are in front-end development: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript (React). I am knowledgeable on back-end programming and can tackle the entire MERN stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything web-based! I especially enjoy working on any sites or apps that will improve our users' lives.
